    "GAME_RULES_BODY": "The game has 3 teams: Residents, Cops and Killers.\nBy the start of the game each player will be assigned to one of those roles. According to the role you were assigned, you will get an access to specified channel for your role. If you don't see any channel after the game starts it is mean that you are a resident.\nEach killer and each cop will have it's own channel, so the game will be fair as it can, no one from the cops will know who is a cop and no one of the killers will know who is him friend.\n\nThe game is simple: Catch all the killers and don't allow them to take lives of residents.",

    "GAME_RULES_HOW_TO_PLAY_BODY": "Every game round is called a night and has 3 steps:\n```1. Killers are choosing their victim\n\tEach killer will be asked in it's own channel who they want to kill.\n\tIf there is only 1 killer alive and free, the chance he will kill the user he choose is randomized. If there is more than 1 killer they all need to select the same user in order to kill him.```\n```2. Cops are getting awake\n\tAt this step each cop should choose one person which he want to arrest. Same as the killers, all the cops need to choose the same person to arrest him.\n\tCops arrest is valid only to 1 night.```\n```3. The last step of each game round is the residents meeting (and both the cops and the killers can participate):\n\tAt the meeting all the residents will be notified on who is got killed and who is got arrested. After that the residents will be asked to vote: Who need to sit at the jail for his rest of the life.\n\tThe player with most the votes will be arrested and wont be able to participate in the game anymore.```"
